# Green House Gas Emission Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on greenhouse gas emission data to identify trends, growth patterns, and emission distribution over time. The objective is to extract meaningful insights using statistical analysis and visualization techniques.

## Problem Statement
Greenhouse gas emissions contribute significantly to climate change. Understanding emission trends across years helps in analyzing environmental impact and identifying growth patterns in emission levels.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analyze emission trends over time
- Visualize patterns using statistical plots
- Identify key contributors and growth trends
- Derive insights from real-world environmental data

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical greenhouse gas emission records across multiple years and categories.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Handling missing values and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory data analysis  
4. Trend analysis using visualizations  
5. Insight extraction from emission patterns  

## Key Insights
- Observed overall emission trend across years  
- Identified growth patterns in emission categories  
- Visual comparison of emission levels using plots
